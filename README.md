## WINS, CHALLENGES & REFLECTIONS 
- Wins: We were able to get the CSS fully responsive, Webpack and Fetch API was new technology that we were able to naviagate to complete the project and we successfully utilized GitHub projects for the first time. 
- Challenges: Delegating work was a challenge since each iteration relied on the the last iteration's completion so we didn't run into blockers or bugs. 
- Reflections: During the project we realized the importance of creating a clear development process from the start. Utilizing the GitHub project board really assisted us in having a clear process and staying on track. 

## PREVIEW OF APP 
- Application implements the fetch API for accessing data from provided Endpoints.
