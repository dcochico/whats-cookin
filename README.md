# What's Cookin'? 

### ABSTRACT
This is an application to track recipes/meal planning that allows users to view recipes they want to cook, with the ingredients and total cost of the recipe for shopping purposes. Users will view a page of recipes, search for recipes by name, fitler recipes by a tag (breakfast, lunch, snack, etc) & favorite recipes. 

### GOALS 
- Object/array prototype methods to manipulate data
- Intuitive UI
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Professional Collaboration 


### TECHNOLOGIES USED 
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Webpack 
- VSCode 
- Fetch API
- Test Driven Development 
- GitHub
- GitHub Projects 

### WINS, CHALLENGES & REFLECTIONS 
- Wins: We were able to get the CSS fully responsive, Webpack and Fetch API was new technology that we were able to naviagate to complete the project and we successfully utilized GitHub projects for the first time. 
- Challenges: Delegating work was a challenge since each iteration relied on the the last iteration's completion so we didn't run into blockers or bugs. 
- Reflections: During the project we realized the importance of creating a clear development process from the start. Utilizing the GitHub project board really assisted us in having a clear process and staying on track.
